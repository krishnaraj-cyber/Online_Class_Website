                                         The 206.8ci Stovebolt overhead-valve six-cylinder was rebuilt utilizing aluminum pistons and is thought to be original for this car, being made in 1934
                                         for a Chevrolet Master Six Sedan. The car starts, runs, and drives great, with no noticeable mechanical problems. The body and undercarriage are in 
                                         great condition and show very little change since restoration. The interior is spotless. This 4-door sedan was well known for the “Knee Action” 
                                         front-suspension. A previous owner trailered this car to AACA events (Antique Automobile Club of America) where it has won 9 AACA Senior Awards.

                                        <p class="paragraphundercarimage">The Toronado began as a design painting by Oldsmobile stylist David North in 1962. His "Flame Red Car" was a compact
                                             sports/personal car never intended for production. A few weeks after the design was finished, however, Oldsmobile division was informed it would be
                                             permitted to build a personal car in the Riviera/Thunderbird class for the 1966 model year, and North's design was selected. For production economy,
                                             the still-unnamed car was to share the so-called E-body shell with the redesigned 1966 Buick Riviera (then entering its second generation), which 
                                             was substantially larger than North had envisioned. Despite the efforts of Oldsmobile and General Motors styling chief Bill Mitchell to put the car
                                             on the smaller A-body intermediate used by the Oldsmobile Cutlass, they were overruled for cost reasons.

                                             light duty asGrandpa's Truck. One look at the undercarriage will convince you that the truck has never seen severe duty or off-road conditions that
                                             wouldcertainly have left road film evidence of history.The pickup was ordered by the dealer with the optional 351E V6 enginethat was available from 
                                             1966 through 1968. The engine is #000414 making it one of the first 500 engines built. This option was referred to as the High-Performance package 
                                             and yielded 190 HP @ 3900 RPM and 220 HP at 4000 RPM and 320 pounds-feet of torque. All that power and torque is transmitted through a Saginaw Manual 
                                             (SM) 420 4speed manual transmission and you don't feel the hills with all thattorque to the rear tires.

                                         were sold, out of total 1959 production of over 142,000 cars. And extremely rare for India, with only a handful of 1959 Cadillacs in the country,
                                         in any body style.Originally painted in deep Georgian Blue, with matching blue leather and cloth trim, the car was ordered with the following factory 
                                         accessories: EZ Eye Safety Glass, Air conditioner, Electric door locks, Power vent window regulators, and Electric 6-way control seat. The car on
                                         offer sports ‘matching-numbers’ –retaining its original engine, chassis, body and other major components as delivered from the factory. A copy of
                                         the build order is available. The car was bought new by an aristocratic family in Bikaner, Rajasthan and later found its way to the outskirts of 
                                         Jodhpur. By the 1990s the car was in poor condition, though largely original. The car left Rajasthan for Delhi, where it changed a couple of hands
                                         before it finally reaching its present owner in 2002. In 2006 the car had undergone a painstaking no-expense-spared restoration at Pandit & Co. 
                                         Genuine parts were imported for the car. The colour chosen was the iconic ‘Elvis Rose’, complemented by white leather upholstery. Brand new correct 
                                         white wall tyres were imported, and all the trim rechromed.

                                    <p class="paragraphundercarimage">The year was 1939 and a lot of cool stuff was happening. The worlds fair opened in New York, Gone with the wind was in theaters.
                                         A lot of not so cool stuff was going on as well. World War 2 started along with the Manhattan project. Lets get back to the cool list though. Chevy also did
                                         a redesign for the Master Deluxe with a new frontend, that took styling cues from the Cadillac. With a 206 under the hood this was the car to have. For Gary 
                                         Herrera his love for the Bombs started over 20 years ago when his good friend Eli Martinez introduced him to the classics. Growing up in Chimayo, Religion,
                                         Family and lowriders is a way of life. The 1939 Master Deluxe you see here has a stock look but once he hits the switch and the car lays the running boards
                                         on the floor you know there is a little more to this car. The factory suspension has been gone through the rear frame C-notched to make sure the car sits
                                         right. Under the hood the Original 205 was replaced with a 235cu in from a 58 Chevy. A split manifold was added so they could run the twice pipes. 
                                         The interior was also re-stitched in Original style and a Banjo Steering wheel was added. All Gary does to the car these days is put gas in it, Cruise
                                         and look for those hard to find accessories.

            <p class="disclaimerpara"> Vintage car collections are curated with care and passion, but they come with inherent risks and considerations. These vehicles may have undergone restoration or preservation efforts, but they still possess age-related wear and tear. Potential buyers should be aware of the following:

                <br><br><b>HISTORICAL AUTHENTICITY:</b> Despite efforts to maintain originality, some components may have been replaced or modified over time. Buyers should conduct thorough inspections or seek professional evaluation for authenticity.
                
                <br><br><b>MECHANICAL CONDITION:</b> Vintage cars may require specialized maintenance due to outdated technology or scarcity of parts. Buyers should anticipate potential mechanical issues and budget accordingly for upkeep and restoration.
                
                <br><br><b>SAFETY CONCERNS:</b> Older vehicles may not meet modern safety standards. Buyers should exercise caution and consider retrofitting safety features or limiting usage to controlled environments.
                
                <br><br><b>INVESTMENT RISKS:</b> While vintage cars can appreciate in value, there's no guarantee of future returns. Market fluctuations, economic conditions, and shifts in collector preferences can impact the investment value of a vintage car collection.
                
                <br><br><b>LEGAL CONSEDERATIONS:</b> Ownership of vintage cars may come with legal obligations such as registration, insurance, and compliance with local regulations. Buyers should familiarize themselves with applicable laws and procedures.
                
                <br><br><b>USAGE LIMITATIONS:</b> Some vintage cars may be better suited for display or occasional use rather than daily driving. Buyers should assess their intended usage and choose vehicles accordingly.
                
                <br><br><b>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT:</b> Vintage cars may have higher emissions and lower fuel efficiency compared to modern vehicles. Owners should consider the environmental implications and explore eco-friendly alternatives where feasible.
                
                <br><br><b>INSURANCE COVERAGE:</b> Vintage cars may require specialized insurance coverage to protect against damage, theft, or liability. Buyers should consult with insurance providers to ensure adequate coverage for their collection.
                
                <br><br>By acquiring a vintage car collection, buyers acknowledge and accept these risks and responsibilities. It's advisable to seek expert advice and conduct thorough research before making any purchase decisions."</p>
